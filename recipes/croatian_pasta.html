    <h2>Description</h2>
        A friend and I basically lived on this dish while we spent a week in Dubrovnik, Croatia. It was the only thing we could reasonably<br>
        cook in the Airbnb we'd rented, which just had a mini-fridge and a one-burner stove. I guess that's a hotplate? Anyway, we'd buy spaghetti,<br>
        onion, zucchini, tomatoes, and any other vegetable that caught our eye, as well as a jar of pre-made pasta sauce. You basically cook all the veggies<br>
        add the sauce and let that simmer to mix in the flavors, then cook the pasta and mix it all together. Red wine is a great addition, both to the sauce<br>
        and the meal as a whole.
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <p></p>
            This is by no means an exhaustive list of ingredients. This dish is an experiment if resourcefulness, so if you don't have everything listed here, <br>

            <li>Knife</li>
            <li>Bottle opener</li>

        </ul>
    <h2> Directions</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>If you're using mushrooms consider boiling them first. It adds a nice crisp in the saute-ing and keeps them juicy.<br>
                Don't worry about how long to boil them, you can't overdo it. Just throw them in a pot of water, set it to boil and let it go<br>
                while you prep all your other vegetables. You don't have to do this but it's my preferred method of preparation.
           <li>Cut up all vegetables to the desired size. I find with spaghetti noodles, bigger pieces are better.<br>
                However, if you're using something smaller like penne, fusilli or orzo, cut them up small</li>
            <li>Set stove to medium high heat and add olive oil to saute pan.</li>
            <li>Don't add veggies all at once, there's an order here. Tougher, more fibrous pieces like onions and bell peppers first. Give mushrooms a little less time<br> 
                and give watery pieces like zucchini the least</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper veggies to taste, then add diced garlic</li>
            <li>let simmer for a few minutes, reduce heat to low</li>
            <li>Once the pan has cooled somewhat add pre-made sauce to pan and stir in veggies</li>
            <li>after testing flavor liberally, add a healthy dose of red wine and stir in</li>
            <li>stir sauce regularly throughout the rest of the preparation</li>
            <li>pour water into pot, add a hefty pinch of salt and set to boil</li>
            <li>once water is boiling, add pasta</li>
            <li>when you feel noodles are complete, pour through strainer</li>
            <li>plate, add sauce, enjoy</li>
        </ol>
